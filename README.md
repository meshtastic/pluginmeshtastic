## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

- **MeshtasticManager**: Central communication handler with connection state management
- **MeshtasticConfigManager**: Intelligent device configuration with TAK optimization
- **BluetoothInterface**: BLE communication layer with Nordic BLE library integration
- **AtakMeshtasticBridge**: High-level message routing and protocol handling
- **MeshtasticBleScanner**: Advanced device discovery with filtering

### Message Flow

1. **ATAK Plugin Messages (Port 72)**: Direct protobuf transmission for small, time-critical data
2. **ATAK Forwarder Messages (Port 257)**: Chunked transmission for large payloads with compression
3. **Automatic Protocol Selection**: Intelligently chooses optimal transmission method
4. **Queue Management**: Monitors device transmission queue to prevent overruns

### Configuration Intelligence

The plugin employs a sophisticated configuration strategy:

1. **Current State Analysis**: Reads existing device configuration before making changes
2. **Selective Modification**: Only updates settings that need optimization
3. **Phased Deployment**: Handles critical configs that require device reboots
4. **Validation**: Verifies configuration success and handles failures gracefully

## Installation

1. Install the plugin APK on your ATAK device
2. Enable the Meshtastic plugin in ATAK's plugin manager
3. Access via the plugin toolbar or dropdown menu

## Quick Start Guide

### First Time Setup

1. **Pair Your Device**:
   - Open the Meshtastic plugin
   - Go to the Connection tab
   - Tap "Scan for Devices"
   - Select your Meshtastic device from the list

2. **Configure Security**:
   - Switch to the Settings tab
   - Enter a secure channel password
   - Tap "Save Password"

3. **Auto-Configuration**:
   - The plugin automatically applies TAK-optimized settings
   - Device may reboot during configuration (normal behavior)
   - Status tab will show "Connected & Configured" when ready

### Daily Use

- Plugin automatically reconnects to your paired device
- Monitor connection status in the Status tab
- Send/receive ATAK messages transparently through the mesh network
- Check signal strength and message statistics as needed

## Advanced Features

### Tactical Configuration
- **Covert Operations**: Disables all unnecessary broadcasts and telemetry
- **Power Efficiency**: Optimizes battery life for extended field operations
- **Local-Only Mode**: Prevents message forwarding beyond immediate mesh
- **Custom PSK**: Uses AES-256 encryption with user-defined passwords
